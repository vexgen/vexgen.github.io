## NIST NVD CVE ANALYSIS RATE REPORT

NVD CVE Analysis Rate Report is a github page created to track NIST NVD CVE Analysis progress during the great NVD analysis/enrichment "slowdown" of 2024.

The goal of this project is to track NVD's CVE analysis progress, and follow steps being taken towards getting NVD back on track. This project was not developed to criticize the hard working folks at NIST. It is simply a tool to track progress and provide a historical record of the NVD's analysis rate.

Data is sourced from the [NVD Dashboard](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard) and report pages are automatically generated daily using the latest available data from NVD. Pages are to be archived daily with the goal of charting progress when enough historical data is availble.


### How it works

nvd_rate_report_tool.py is used to generate the report pages. It is a simple python script that reads the NVD Dashboard page and generates a markdown report page. 

Requirements:
- Python 3
- requests
- BeautifulSoup4
- Selenium

To run the script use the command:
```python3 nvd_rate_report_tool.py```

The script will output an HTML markdown file (default "index.html") with the report for the current day. 

nvd_cve_analysis.db is a sqlite3 database that stores the data extracted from the report. The database is updated daily with the latest data from NVD. Database updates are not currently generated by the script, but an updated copy is uploaded to the repository daily.
