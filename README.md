## NIST NVD CVE ANALYSIS RATE REPORT

NVD CVE Analysis Rate Report is a github page created to track NIST NVD CVE Analysis progress during the great NVD analysis/enrichment "slowdown" of 2024.

The goal of this project is to track NVD's CVE analysis progress, and follow steps being taken towards getting NVD back on track. This project was not developed to criticise the hard working folks at NIST.

Data is sourced from the [NVD Dashboard](https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard) and report pages are automatically generated daily using the latest available data from NVD. Pages are to be archived daily with the goal of charting progress when enough historical data is availble.
