There is a current backlog of 14623 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 115.47 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 189.7 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 160.17 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31553.18.</p>",
