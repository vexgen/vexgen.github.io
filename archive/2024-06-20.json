There is a current backlog of 14924 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 116.11 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 193.04 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 163.43 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31705.0.</p>",
