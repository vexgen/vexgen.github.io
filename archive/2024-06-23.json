There is a current backlog of 15077 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 115.15 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 194.09 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 164.66 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31449.52.</p>",
