There is a current backlog of 15488 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 113.57 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 197.74 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 168.61 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31024.96.</p>",
