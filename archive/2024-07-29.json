At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 29.99. There is a current backlog of 17018 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 111.3 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 221.09 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 191.1 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 29621.05.</p>",
