At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 30.1. There is a current backlog of 17118 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 111.9 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 223.06 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 192.96 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 29715.2.</p>",
