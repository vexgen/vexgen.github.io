At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 34.9. There is a current backlog of 17704 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 110.2 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 250.71 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 215.81 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 27191.8.</p>",
