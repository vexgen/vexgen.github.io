At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 41.64. There is a current backlog of 17972 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 106.82 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 302.17 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 260.53 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 23968.56.</p>",
