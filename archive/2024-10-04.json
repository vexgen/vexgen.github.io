At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 42.17. There is a current backlog of 17931 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 106.53 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 310.29 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 268.12 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 23594.68.</p>",
