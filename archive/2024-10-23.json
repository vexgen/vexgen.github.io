At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 44.44. There is a current backlog of 18716 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 107.47 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 378.72 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 334.28 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 23065.07.</p>",
