At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 44.93. There is a current backlog of 19021 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 107.82 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 409.74 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 364.81 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 22983.07.</p>",
