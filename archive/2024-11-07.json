At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 46.32. There is a current backlog of 19111 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 107.69 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 461.6 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 415.28 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 22424.98.</p>",
