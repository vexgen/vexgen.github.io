At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 48.16. There is a current backlog of 20660 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 109.84 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 847.7 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 799.54 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 22387.04.</p>",
