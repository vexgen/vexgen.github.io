At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 48.33. There is a current backlog of 20596 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 109.51 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 872.32 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 823.99 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 22247.86.</p>",
