At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 48.79. There is a current backlog of 21022 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 110.02 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 1111.07 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 1062.28 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 22307.83.</p>",
