At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 103.11. There is a current backlog of 23743 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 129.47 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 210.23 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 107.12 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31492.84.</p>",
