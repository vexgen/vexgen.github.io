At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 103.04. There is a current backlog of 23520 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 127.25 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 208.63 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 105.59 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 30516.69.</p>",
