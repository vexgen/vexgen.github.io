At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 103.63. There is a current backlog of 24110 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.99 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 218.29 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 114.66 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 32792.96.</p>",
