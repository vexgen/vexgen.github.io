At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 101.1. There is a current backlog of 24207 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 131.97 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 219.68 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 118.58 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 32727.12.</p>",
