At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 107.01. There is a current backlog of 24117 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.44 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 222.76 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 115.75 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 31253.1.</p>",
