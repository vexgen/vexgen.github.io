At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 110.72. There is a current backlog of 24973 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 136.4 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 245.93 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 135.21 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 30828.04.</p>",
