At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 110.29. There is a current backlog of 24901 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.62 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 249.44 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 139.15 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 29916.95.</p>",
