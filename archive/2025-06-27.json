At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 110.19. There is a current backlog of 25404 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 132.09 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 267.94 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 157.75 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 29499.3.</p>",
