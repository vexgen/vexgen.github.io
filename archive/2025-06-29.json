At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 108.99. There is a current backlog of 25404 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 130.61 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 267.93 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 158.94 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 29403.7.</p>",
