    <p>The following estimates are calculated using data from the <a href='https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard'>NVD Dashboard</a>. At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 113.39. There is a current backlog of 25605 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 134.33 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 319.87 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 206.48 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 28494.72.</p>
