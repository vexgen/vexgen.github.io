At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 113.05. There is a current backlog of 25488 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.44 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 335.73 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 222.68 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 28057.14.</p>",
