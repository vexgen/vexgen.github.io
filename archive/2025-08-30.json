At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 111.87. There is a current backlog of 25737 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.46 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 342.7 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 230.83 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 28392.57.</p>",
