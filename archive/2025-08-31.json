At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 111.4. There is a current backlog of 25737 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.1 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 344.06 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 232.66 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 28384.4.</p>",
