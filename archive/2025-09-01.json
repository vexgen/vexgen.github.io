At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 110.95. There is a current backlog of 25737 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 132.88 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 345.58 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 234.63 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 28390.53.</p>",
