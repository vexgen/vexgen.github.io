At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 111.51. There is a current backlog of 26283 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.86 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 379.5 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 267.99 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 28674.45.</p>",
