At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 115.43. There is a current backlog of 26301 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 133.04 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 1107.15 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 991.72 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 26776.47.</p>",
