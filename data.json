There is a current backlog of 14939 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 116.2 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 193.21 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 163.34 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31687.02.</p>",
