At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 42.35. There is a current backlog of 17920 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 106.53 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 310.17 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 267.82 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 23567.84.</p>",
