At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 36.8. There is a current backlog of 17618 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 109.13 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 259.71 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 222.91 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 26080.61.</p>",
