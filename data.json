At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 29.59. There is a current backlog of 16476 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 112.92 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 209.84 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 180.25 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 30642.1.</p>",
