At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2025 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 110.72. There is a current backlog of 25385 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 132.72 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 263.57 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 152.85 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2025 will be 29653.0.</p>",
