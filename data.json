There is a current backlog of 15239 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 115.26 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 195.89 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 166.32 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31434.41.</p>",
