There is a current backlog of 15623 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 113.74 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 199.11 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 170.14 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31135.91.</p>",
