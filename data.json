At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 29.15. There is a current backlog of 16193 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 113.28 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 205.81 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 176.66 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 30915.75.</p>",
