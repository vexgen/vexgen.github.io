    <p>The following estimates are calculated using data from the <a href='https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard'>NVD Dashboard. </a> At the time of this reports generation, NVD's 2024 daily average for analyzing new CVEs is 29.51. There is a current backlog of 15422 CVEs awaiting analysis. With an average influx of 115.11 new CVEs per day, a daily average of 197.58 analyses is required to clear this backlog and process new CVEs. Currently, NVD is falling short of this goal by 168.07 CVEs a day. Given this data, if the current daily rate of CVE analysis persists, the projected number of CVEs awaiting analysis by the end of 2024 will be 31429.2.</p>
